I am a Software Engineer at [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), where I joined the Agile Engineering & Innovation Department in 2022. My interests are primarily in AI/ML and Data Science, but I am a Computer Scientist, so I enjoy solving many differnt types of problems. I received my [B.S. in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/compsci/academics/undergraduate) at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) and am currently pursuing my [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/compsci/academics/graduate) there as well. Prior to beginning my career in CS I was a Navy Helicopter Rescue Swimmer as well as a Crew Chief. (For a glimpse at my past life, go [here](https://www.seaforces.org/usnair/HSC/Helicopter-Sea-Combat-Squadron-22.htm).)
