I am a Software Engineer at [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), where I joined the Agile Engineering & Innovation Department in 2022. My interests are primarily in AI/ML and Data Science, but I am a Computer Scientist, so I enjoy solving many differnt types of problems. I received my [B.S. in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/compsci/academics/undergraduate) from [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) and am currently pursuing my [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/compsci/academics/graduate) there as well. Prior to beginning my career in CS, I was a Navy Helicopter Rescue Swimmer as well as a Crew Chief. (For a glimpse at some of that, go [here](/navy/).)

## Activities

When I have time, I enjoy outdoor activities and cooking. My favorite type of cooking is with a smoker. This was my first try at a Thanksgiving turkey, it turned out pretty good!

As far as outdoor activites go, I like all kinds. While in the Navy, I was a part of Continuing Promise 2015, on our return home we stopped at Barbados and I got to surf for the first time. It was awesome, I was not.

My 'go to' activity is golf. In 2019 I went to the PGA Championship at Bethpage Black in New York with my brother. We played a round at a nearby course. I'm not sure what he is looking at here, but perhaps I should have been looking at the same thing. I'm decent, but he is really good, I guess I need to get on that program.

I don't get to do as many activites as I used to, but that's okay. What I have now is better. In 2019 my wife and I had twin boys. Here's a picture of my wonderful family a few months after the boys were born.

And... here is a more recent picture of the boys trying to figure out how to get into my shed.

Yeah, I've got my hands full, but I still get to do some outdoor activites. My boys love hiking, and we have plenty of places to go!
